Make a choice, and the link will appear as `[Github](https://github.com/)` in your markdown file.\r\n\r\nYou may also query [urls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator) for the current visual selection by pressing 'u'.\r\n\r\n<video src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/230109/videos/vim_googurl.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg\" controls>\r\n</video> \r\n","tagline":"A vim plugin for creating Markdown links from a Google query","google":"UA-30546313-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
